# Exploring patterns of basic needs in college students

Food insecurity among college students is problem that can impact student performance in the classroom and ultimately effect student success. The purpose of this cross-sectional pilot study was to create a tool that identifies student perception of the impact of receiving [CalFresh](https://www.csuchico.edu/calfresh/index.shtml) assistance on their health, nutrition, cooking confidence, time management and academic performance. 

The [Center for Healthy Communities](https://www.csuchico.edu/chc/) (CHC) developed the **Basic Needs Student Success Survey (BNS3)** and administered it to undergraduate students at [California State University, Chico](https://www.csuchico.edu/) in April 2019. The [Educational Opportunity Program](https://www.csuchico.edu/eop/) (EOP) office assisted in the recruitment and provided computers for students to take the survey. Participants were given a $25 gift card for their participation. 

This report provides a top level descriptive analysis of each question in the survey. Researchers and campus staff are encouraged to review the information in this analysis to formulate further research hypotheses and questions.
